# Wide

```
We've received reports that Draeger has stashed a huge arsenal in the pocket dimension Flaggle Alpha. You've managed to smuggle a discarded access terminal to the Widely Inflated Dimension Editor from his headquarters, but the entry for the dimension has been encrypted. Can you make it inside and take control?
```

The above is the description for a Hack The Box challenge titled "WIDE." The description instructs me to a "dimension" however it is encrypted. Downloading the challenge files there are two items in the zip folder `wide` and `db.exe`.

`wide` is a Linux ELF binary
```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/htb/challenges/crypto/wide]
└─# file wide          
wide: ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, BuildID[sha1]=13869bb7ce2c22f474b95ba21c9d7e9ff74ecc3f, not stripped
```

`db.ex` is a `Matlab` file according to `file`, I've never heard of this type of file before. 
```
┌──(root㉿kali)-[~/htb/challenges/crypto/wide]
└─# file db.ex
db.ex: Matlab v4 mat-file (little endian) , numeric, rows 1835627088, columns 29557

```


Running the binary with the `db.ex` file gives a menu of the "Widely Inflated Dimension Editor." Pressing 1,2,3,4, etc on the keyboard will select the respective Dimension.

Flaggle Alpha (#6) is encrypted and probably contains the flag for this challenge.

I opened up `ghidra` and imported the `wide` binary. `ghidra` was able to identify a function called `menu` and looking at the code there I found a hard-coded password. `sup3rs3cr3tw1d3`

Putting that password into the binary revealed the flag
